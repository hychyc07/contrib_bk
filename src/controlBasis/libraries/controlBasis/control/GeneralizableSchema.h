 *
 * This class implementes a generalizable Control Basis Schema whose state is 
 * evaluted as the dynamic state of the available actions (both controllers
 * and schema used hierarchically).  Reward is accomplished though the convergence of 
 * controllers that engage stimuli from the environment as reference signals.
 * The dynamic state of actions is evaluated as s={UNKNOWN,UNDEFINED,UNCONVERGED,CONVERGED}.
 *
 * This schema is "generalizable" because it parameterizes the control actions
 * by resources it has learned are most likely to lead to success (reward)
 * based on the run-time context.  For example, a robot can accomplish a 
 * "reaching" action with its left or right arm depending on the location
 * of the object to be reached to.  
 *
 * !!!BEWARE!!!! This is work in progress (and not all the pieces are implemented yet...)
