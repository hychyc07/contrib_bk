This file explains how to use the python script in the directory.

asvPlot.py : plots events in the space of the sensor. It words for ASV chip and DVS chip

asvRaster.py: plots the events in time sorting them out by the metapixel and adding type information. It receives as input a file through the sys.stdin with the mapping and the series of events ex.: cat asvTot.txt | python asvRaster.py --asv


asvRasterFile.py: Similar to the previous script, this can be run from the python terminal. It does not represent the matlab plot straight away but all the variables are readable for any additional computation
ex.: 	Python>>>> from asvRasterFile import *
     	Python>>>> p.plot(xRaster,yRaster, 'o')
  	Python>>>> p.show()
