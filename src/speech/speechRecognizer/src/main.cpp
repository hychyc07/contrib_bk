\defgroup icub_speechRecognizer Process to speech recognition, 
          and online vocabulory / grammar management.
@ingroup icub_speech

\section intro_sec Description
The module based on Microsoft Speech API. It is made to recognize speech based on runtime grammar in different formats:
 * XML W3C specification
 * "custom" simple format closed to the one used in the CSLU RAD Toolkit.
 The class RobotGrammarManager maintains a dictionary of various vocabulories usefull in HRI (Objects, Agents, Actions...) which can be
 expanded at runtime and can be used in grammars.

\section lib_sec Libraries
Microsoft speech sdk http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh361572(v=office.14).aspx

\section parameters_sec Parameters
--grammarFile specify the name of the grammar file to load at startup
--talkback if specified the program will use TTS to repeat every sentence recognized
 
\section portsa_sec Ports Accessed
If iSpeak is running then all text to speech commands will be forwarded to iSpeak.

\section portsc_sec Interface: Ports Created and data format
/modulename/recog/continuous:o broadcast commands recognized by the asynchronous grammar (see rpc commands "asynrecog" )
/moduleName/rpc handles rpc commands of type
 * "tts" "sentence to say"
    Say a sentence
 
 * "asyncrecog"
 
    ** "addGrammar"...
    Add a simple grammar (uses current state of RGM) to the asynchronous grammar
 
    ** "clear"...
    Reset the asynchrnous grammar to its original state
 
 * "recog"
    
    ** "timeout" "ms"
    Set the timeout for all recognition actions
 
    ** "choices" "choice1" "choice2"...
    Run a recognition over the list of choices passed in arguments. Returns the word/sentence recognized
    
    ** "dictation"
    [NOT IMPLEMENTED YET] Run a recognition of open dictation
 
    ** "grammarXML" "xml formatted grammar"
     [NOT IMPLEMENTED YET] Run the recognition of a grammar specified in the W3C SRGS xml format (http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-grammar/)
 
    ** "grammarSimple" "grammar to recognize"
    Run a recognition on a custom format using RobotGrammarManager, refer to RobotGrammarSpecification.txt

 * "RGM" "vocabulory"
    ** "get" "vocabuloryName"
     [NOT IMPLEMENTED YET] return a string containing all the vocabulory words
   
    ** "add" "vocabuloryName" "word"
    Expand a given vocabulory with a specific word
 
    ** "addAuto" "vocabuloryName"
     [NOT IMPLEMENTED YET] Expand a given vocabulory by putting the system in dictation mode and asking confirmation of what is being recognized
