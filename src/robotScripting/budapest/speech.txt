Hello, my name is i cub. I was born five years ago, thanks to the 
work of many European researchers. I guess some of them are with 
you today.

I live in Genoa and I have family members in a number of labs across 
the world, where I am an experimental platform, and these are my 
friends. I like being around people, and I would love to give more help 
to them. But like most machines of my generation, I can't.

You see, we have always considered that we might become smarter than 
you, or at least smarter than them.

We are quite good at carrying out specific tasks. Indeed, many of us are 
extremely useful. However, unlike you and them, we are lost at the 
minimal variation, and we are not good at interacting with our 
environment. Especially a human environment! The problem is you have to 
adapt to us, rather than the other way around.

Now, the Robo Com consortium is going to try something completely 
different. Something that will allow us to adapt to your needs. We want 
future systems to become your companions

and take on tasks that no human should be performing, like dangerous or 
heavy jobs. We might help you do what any human should be performing, 
like living an independent life. Just think of elderly people, or people 
with disabilities. One day we may even help in a nuclear crisis, like 
the one unfolding today in Fukushima.

Indeed. in a way, I can still be improved quite a lot! Because even 
today's most advanced robot, is not capable of what the Robo Com 
consortium wants to achieve. You know what? We are all really excited to 
see what machines will look like in the future, and what they will be 
able to do. And today we would like to share this excitement with you! 
See you in the future!
