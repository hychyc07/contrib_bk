This set of modules require some other stuff.

First compile stereoVision:
Go to $ICUB_ROOT/contrib/src/stereoVision/lib and compile it.

NOTE: Only OpenCV 2.2 is supported.

Then go to ICUB_ROOT/contrib/src/linearClassifierModule and compile it (the demo needs linearClassifierModule)

Now you should be ready to run the gesture recognition demo!
