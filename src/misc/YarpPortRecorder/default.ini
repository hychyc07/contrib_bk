//This is the configuration file for "YarpPortRecorder" module
//Parameters:
//name - is a module name and constitutes the first part of local port names
//captureinterval - time interval between two port consequtive port reads in milliseconds
//delayb4capture - the amount of delay in milliseconds between module execution and recording begins
//filesizelimit -  the limitation for the output file size (this check is not yet implemented so do not matter)
//outputfilename - output file name
//rpc            - name + rpc constitutes the rpc port name
//[PORTS]
//remote1 - name of the first port to record
//local1 -  name+local1 constitutes a local port name which connects to remote1
//nrecords1 - number of records to be made from the remote1 port. If zero then there is no limit. 
//remote2 --! 
//local2    !-> similar to remote1,local1,nrecords1 but for second port to record..
//nrecords2_! 
//remote"n" --!
//local"n"    !-> Specs of port "n".If desired can add as many ports to record as neccessary. 
//nrecords"n"-!                     The port numbering should have no gaps.
