RobotGrammarManager uses a custom format for defining grammars.
It handles a dictionnary of vocabulories, by default 3 vocabulories are created at startup :
#Object, #Agent and #Action.

The grammar definition is fairly simple :
"Please #Agent #Action the #object with the other #Object | Did you #Action the #Object ?"
Will recognize the according sentences using the vocabulories defined previously. The operator '|' allows you to specify multiple different
sentences to be recognized.

Some special vocabulories can be used : 
#Dictation : provides an open recognition (can be multiple words at the moment. Todo : make it so that only one word is recognized)
#WildCard : recognize any word, but doesn't returns it (it returns [...] )
