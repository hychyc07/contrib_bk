Build instructions:

Linux (tested on Ubuntu 10.04):

1. Install your favourite Blas/Lapack implementation
	e.g. installing Netlib's Blas and Lapack:
	$ sudo apt-get install libblas-dev libblas3gf liblapack3gf

2. Install Boost's libraries date_time and serialization
	$ sudo apt-get install libboost-serialization1.40.0 libboost-serialization1.40-dev libboost-date-time1.40.0 libboost-date-time1.40-dev

3 To link against some Blas and Lapack implementations you may need a fortran compiler
	e.g. for Netlib's Blas and Lapack:
	$ sudo apt-get install gfortran

4. Create a buld directory (e.g. "build") for gurls++
	$ cd $GURLS_ROOT
	$ mkdir build

5. Run cmake into the build directory
	$ cd build
	$ ccmake ..

6. Start gurls++ building
	$ make
