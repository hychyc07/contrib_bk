\mainpage The GURLS Package in C++

<p>This C++ library provides an object oriented framework to solve
supervised mult-class learning problems using a regularized least
square approach.

<p>GURLS++ is the C++ implementation of the Matlab toolbox GURLS
(http://cbcl.mit.edu/gurls/).

<p>The ultimate goal of the authors and contributors to GURLS++ has
been to develop a comprehensive library to solve easily classication
and regression problems both in the setting of batch and online
learning from examples.

<p>Both GURLS and GURLS++ allows for training multiclass classifiers
based on the Regularized Least Squares (RLS) loss function.
The libraries encode ideas and experience from
classical and more recent developments in theory and practice of
multicategory classification. The software package includes efficient methods
to automatically select good model parameters, to use a variety of
output coding schemes and an easy interface for experiment management
and results visualization. The software package includes a number of
routines especially designed to deal with massive datasets,
furthermore, it is instrinsically modular and each method can be
used independently.

<p>GURLS and GURLS++ have been developed within the context of the
IIT\@MIT Lab, established
between the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the
Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) to develop novel learning and
perception technologies/algorithms for learning, especially in the
visual perception domain, that are inspired by the neuroscience of
sensory systems and are developed within the rapidly growing theory
of computational learning.

<p><strong>Software Package</strong></p>

The GURLS package is more than a collection of optimization
routines, its design allows for quickly composing various experiments
by varying the parameter selection, performance evaluation and the
optimization procedures. The GURLS package has three main features:

<ol>
<li>A core library consisting of parameter selection and a wide range of optimization routines for building regularized least squares classifiers.
<li>Automated tools for building principled classifiers, where most decisions for building an optimal classifier are taken by the package based on theory.
<li>A simple and easy-to-use, and easy-to-extend benchmarking framework for rapidly prototyping learning algorithms with various components.
</ol>

<p><strong>Benchmarking Framework</strong></p>

The GURLS package allows the user to quickly design and compare
experiments, run with different pattern recognition pipelines
(for example, comparing the performance of linear vs. non-linear
classifiers on a given dataset). The output of each task in the
sequence is stored in a particular format by GURLS, which makes it
easy for the package to combine the results and present them as plots
or tables.


<p><strong>Current Development Status</strong></p>

The current version of this C++ library implements all the core
functionalities available in GURLS but still miss the functionalities
required to handle large scale machine learning. A major upgrade and
revision will be available soon. Check out the main GURLS repository
at (https://github.com/CBCL/GURLS) and keep updated for futher developments.

  <p><strong>History of revisions</strong></p>

<ol>


<li> Version 1.0.00, released 2012 June 1th. GURLS++ 1.0.00 is the first
complete release.

<li> Version 0.1.00, released 2011 October 7th. GURLS++ 0.1.00 is an initial
release and should be used with caution. The library has already been
in use, but not every function/method has been thoroughly tested.
Only a limited subset of GURLS is interfaced. Commens, bugfixes,
enhancements, suggestions are wellcome.
