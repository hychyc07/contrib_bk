\defgroup icub_boltzmanMachineDemo BoltzmanMachineDemo

Demo which shows all the possible function of the Boltzmann Machine Library sending commands via an Interface Component composed by engine and graphical interface

\section intro_sec Description

\image html boltzmannMachineLibrary.png

Through the Boltzmann Machine library the user is able to:
- load a Boltzmann Machine with a pre-exhisting structure
- add Layers of different dimensions
- clamp an input data to one specific visible layer
- let the boltzmann Machine evolve
- save the boltzmann Machine

The GUI helps the user to perform all these actions in a more friendly environment
The GUI is connected to the Engine Module which incapsulate the library


\section dep_sec Dependencies
Assumes \ref icub_iCubInterface (with cartesian control implemented) is running.

\section int_sec Instantiated Modules
- \ref icub_bmlEngine "bmlEngine" 

- \ref bmlInterface "bmlInterface" 


\section howto_sec How to run the Application

- Selection A of the input data and all the layers
In the upper section either the input data or one of the layers can be selected.
When selected the graphic frame in the center of the windows represent the selection
- Main section
Where all the operations on the whole boltzmann machine are grouped. In this section a series of parameters can be tune.
- Operation on selections
Here all the operation which require a reference to one or more layers are listed.
The reference A is related to Selection A whereas the reference B links within this section.

\section ex_howto Example on How to use the Application

1) Load the Boltzmann Machine
2) Select the dimension of the layer and Add on or more layers
3) Visualise the layers and the input data
4) Clamp the input data on the visible layer
5) Interconnect different layers
6) Evolve the Boltzmann Machine and see how the layers change
7) Save the actual situation (connection, state, etc ...)
