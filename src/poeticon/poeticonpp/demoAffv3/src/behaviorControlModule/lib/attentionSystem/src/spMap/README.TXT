Module: spherical_projection.
Released under the terms of the GNU GPL.


This module defines functions and provides a simple example for image spherical projection. In such images, pixels are linearly related to view angle, thus simplifying the computation of relative directions between world points positions and camera orientation.

The module is organized as a Library (see /src and /include) and a sample yarp application (see /example).
