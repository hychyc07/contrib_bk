This is the application used to run the attention system, distributed 
across a cluster of computers.

\section intro_sec Description
Run the attention system.

\section dep_sec Dependencies
Assumes \ref icub_iCubInterface is running, and that the head is instantiated.

\section int_sec Instantiated Modules

\section parameters_sec Parameters

See below.

\section config_sec Configuration Files

The application directory is assumed to contain a certain sub-folder structure. 
Currently a ./conf folder is required.

File: /app/attentionDistributed/config.sh

config.sh contains all information required by the module start scripts and the yarp connect script. 

Global application values are:

- Name of the robot

- Portnames of the robot (controlboards, image grabbers, etc.)

- Absolute path to the module binaries (no trailing slash) (this path might need to be changed depending on the operation system used; windows uses the /bin/debug folder for compiled binaries whereas Linux uses the /bin folder)

- Absolute path to the application directory (no trailing slash)

For robot devices config.sh contains:

- Device parameters or the configuration file used by the device driver

For every module config.sh contains:

- Name of the executable

- Config file to use

- Name of the module (base portname to use)

- All portnames opened by this module

Configuration of the devices running on the iCub are defined in config.sh or in the configuration file specified. 
The controlboard is currently assumed to be located in iCub/conf .

All configuration options (except portnames) are contained in the according configuration file in 
the local ./conf folder.
