endogenousSalience.xml.template

This application demonstates the use of the endogenousSalience module which 
effects a simple endogenous salience computation using colour segmentation.
The input image is segmented into foreground and background, the largest blob in the foreground is identified, 
and the centroid of this blob is used to define the location of the most salient region.

The colour segmentation is carried out in HS (Hue-Saturation) space.
The parameters for the segmentation, i.e. the hue and saturation ranges of foreground regions, 
are extracted automatically from a log-polar image which is provided as input to the module.  
Typically, this log-polar image will have been generated by the attention system when fixating 
on some point of interest.
 
The application runs offline and the imageSource module simulates the icub camera and 
streams an image from a file to a port at a given frequency. 
Random noise is added to each image to differentiate between frames. 
In this application, the images are sent to a logPolarTransform module and also to
the endogenousSalience.   The output of the logPolarTransform is then sent to the 
endogenousSalience to allow the parameters of the colour segmentation to be determined.

The image file is provided in the $ICUB_ROOT/contrib/src/cognitiveArchitecture/app/endogenousSalience/conf directory
along with the relevant initialization configuration files.

Please refer to the imageSource module documentation for further details on the 
module parameters: http://wiki.icub.org/iCub/dox/html/group__icub__endogenousSalience.html

Edit the xml.template file to suit your own platform.  The only change that should be 
necessary is to replace the node name (icub1 in the template).
