sampleVideo.xml.template

This application demonstates the use of the imageSource and sampleVideo modules.
The imageSource module streams an image from a file to a port at a given frequency. 
Random noise is added to each image to differentiate between frames. In this application, 
the imageSource module streams the images to /icub/cam/left.
The sampleVideo module sub-samples the stream of images to produce output images at a given frequency.

The image file is provided in the $ICUB_ROOT/contrib/src/cognitiveArchitecture/src/sampleVideo/conf directory
along with the imageSource.ini and sampleVideo.ini configuration files.

Edit the xml.template file to suit your own platform.  
The only changes that should be necessary are 

- modify the node name to whatever is specified in your yarp run --server /nodename command (icub1 in the template)
- modify the path to the /conf directory in the context parameter 
  (remember: the resource finder searches from $ICUB_ROOT/app/ so make the path relative to this.
- make sure that the port dependencies are satisfied
