 *
 * Affective state is a competitive network of three motives: 
 * 
 * - curiosity (dominated by exogenous factors)
 * - experimentation (dominated by endogenous factors)
 * - social engagement (where exogenous and endogenous factors balance)
 * 
 * The outcome of this competition fed to the actionSelection module which produces a cognitive behaviour 
 * that is biased towards learning (motivated by curiousity), and
 * prediction and reconstruction (motivated by curiousity and social engagement).
 * 
 * Both curiousity and experimentation are forms of exploration.   
 * 
 * Social engagement is an exploratory act to but it focusses on the establishment of a common basis 
 * for mutual interations with others rather than on acquiring new knowledge about the world. 
 * In a sense, exploration concerns the acquisition of knowledge, whereas social engagement concerns 
 * the agreement of knowledge.
 * 
 * In the current implementation, we target only simple forms of curiousity and experimentation motives.   
 * 
 * Both motives are modelled as a temporal series of event-related spikes.
 * The current level of a motivation is a weighted sum of recent spiking activity, with weighting being biased 
 * towards most recent spikes.  Specifically, the weighting function decreases linearly from 1 to 0 as a function
 * of the time.  
 *
 * The number of time intervals over which the sum is taken is provided as a parameter to the module.
 * 
 * Curiousity and experimentation have different spiking functions.
 * 
 * A curiousity spike occurs when either a new event is recorded in the episodic memory 
 * or when an event that has not recently been recalled is accessed in the episodic memory.
 *
 * The number of time slots that determine the expiry of an event (and hence whether or not is has been recently recalled)
 * is provided as a parameter to the module.
 * 
 * An experimentation spike occurs when an event / image which is predicted or reconstructed by the procedural memory 
 * and recalled by the episodic memory is subsequently recalled again by the episodic memory, typically as a result of
 * the endogenous salience successfully causing the attention system to attend to the predicted / reconstructed event.
 * This is equivalent to the sequential recall of the same event in episodic memory when in either prediction or
 * reconstruction action mode.
 *
 * The affectiveState module takes as input the imageId  and the action output 
 * from the actionSelection module.
 * 
 *
 * The affectiveState module has the following inputs: 
 * 
 * - image vector containing eight numbers
 *   -# an image id. number for the matched image
 *   -# a match value r, 0 <= r <= 1, for the matched image
 *   -# the azimuth angle of the gaze at which the image was acquired
 *   -# the elevation angle of the gaze at which the image was acquired
 *   -# the vergence angle of the gaze at which the image was acquired
 *
 *   This is typically input from the episodicMemory module.
 *
 * - mode vector containing a single value denoting the mode of operation
 *   - 0 (learning)
 *   - 1 (prediction) 
 *   - 2 (reconstruction) 
 *
 *   This is typically input from the actionSelection module.
 *
 *
 * The affectiveState module has one output: affective state vector containing four numbers
 *
 *    -# the current curiousity level 
 *    -# the instantaneous rate of change of curiousity level
 *    -# the current experimentation level 
 *    -# the instantaneous rate of change of experimentation level

 * 
 * <b>Command-line Parameters</b>
 * 
 * The following key-value pairs can be specified as command-line parameters by prefixing \c -- to the key 
 * (e.g. \c --from \c file.ini ). The value part can be changed to suit your needs; the default values are shown below. 
 *
 * - \c from \c affectiveState.ini       \n
 *   specifies the configuration file
 *
 * - \c context \c affectiveState/conf   \n 
 *   specifies the sub-path from \c $ICUB_ROOT/icub/app to the configuration file
 *
 * - \c name \c affectiveState \n         
 *   specifies the name of the module (used to form the stem of module port names)  
 *
 * 
 * <b>Module Configuration File Parameters</b>
 *
 * The following key-value pairs can be specified as parameters in the configuration file e.g. \c affectiveState.ini 
 * (they can also be specified as command-line parameters if you so wish). 
 * The value part can be changed to suit your needs; the default values are shown below. 
 *   
 * - \c imageIdInPort       \c /imageId:i       \n  
 *   The input port name for the current image id. number and match value
 *
 * - \c modePort            \c /mode:i          \n  
 *   The input port name for the mode (corresponding to learning, prediction, reconstruction) 
 *
 * - \c stateOutPort        \c /state:o       \n 
 *   The output port name for the affective state value  
 *
 * - \c duration            \c 3              \n
 *   specifies the number of time samples to be used when computing the weighted average spiking rate.
 *
 * - \c expiry              \c 10              \n
 *   specifies the number of time samples after which an image expires (and, hence, will be interpreted as a new event
 *   for the purposes of determining the occurence of a curiousity spike).
 *
 *
 * \section portsa_sec Ports Accessed
 * 
 * - none
 *                      
 * \section portsc_sec Ports Created
 *
 * <b>Input ports</b>
 *
 * - \c /affectiveState \n
 *   This port is used to change the parameters of the module at run time or stop the module
 *   The following commands are available
 * 
 *   \c help \n
 *   \c quit
 *   \c set \c len \c <n>   ... set the number of time intervals over which the spike stream sum is computed.
 *   \c set \c exp \c <n>   ... set the number of time intervals after which an image expires.
 *   (where \c <n> is an integer number in the range [0,100] and m is an integer number >= 0)
 *
 *   Note that the name of this port mirrors whatever is provided by the \c --name parameter value
 *   The port is attached to the terminal so that you can type in commands and receive replies.
 *   The port can be used by other modules but also interactively by a user through the yarp rpc directive, viz.: \c yarp \c rpc \c /rectification
 *   This opens a connection from a terminal to the port and allows the user to then type in commands and receive replies.
 *       
 * - \c /affectiveState/imageId:i 
 * - \c /affectiveState/mode:i
 *
 *
 * <b>Output ports</b>
 *
 * - \c /affectiveState 
 * - \c /affectiveState/state:o 
 *
 * <b>Port types </b>
 *
 * The functional specification only names the ports to be used to communicate with the module 
 * but doesn't say anything about the data transmitted on the ports. This is defined by the following code. 
 *
 * - \c BufferedPort<VectorOf<double> >  \c imageIdInPort;          \c // \c image_id, \c match_value, \c azimuth, \c elevation, \c previous_image_id, \c match_value, \c azimuth, \c elevation
 * - \c BufferedPort<VectorOf<double> >  \c modePort;               \c // \c mode  
 * - \c BufferedPort<VectorOf<double> >  \c stateOutPort;           \c // \c state
