 *
 * This is a module that creates the infrastructure Observer-Observables in order to handle a state machine for gaze control.
 * 
 * 
 * \image html visualAttentionBUTD.jpg
 * 
 * \section Description
 * This machine swaps between state and every state represent a different vision behaviour (saccade, vergence, tracking, ect)
 * Every behaviour has a particular priority and the controller of this machine has to take the priority into account and send the correct output to the
 * kinematic control of the gaze.
 * The Observables receive gaze request from the lower level and report these to the Observer

 *    The following commands are available
 * 
 *  -  \c help \n
 *  -  \c quit \n
 *
 *    Note that the name of this port mirrors whatever is provided by the \c --name parameter value
 *    The port is attached to the terminal so that you can type in commands and receive replies.
 *    The port can be used by other modules but also interactively by a user through the yarp rpc directive, viz.: \c yarp \c rpc \c /visualFilter
 *    This opens a connection from a terminal to the port and allows the user to then type in commands and receive replies.
 *       
 *  - \c /gazeArbiter/matchTracker/img:i
 *      port where the input image for imageTracking is sent
 *
 * <b>Output ports</b>

 *  - \c /gazeArbiter/status:o 
 *    port where the status of the controller is communicated
