Application which simulates the attention system based on proto-object, distributed across a cluster of computers.

\section intro_sec Description
Run the attention system using logpolar image.The colourProcessor and the imageProcessing module are in charge of preprocessing the input image.
The saliencyBlobFinder is a blob extractor module based on Proto-Objects. In other words given images which simulates center-surround receptive fields with spectrally opponent
colour responses the system extracts a series of edges that are likely to be boundaries of proto-objects. Proto-objects can be defined as regions of the image
that are likely to bound into object by an higher level attentive system. Applying the watershed process (rain falling algorithm),
the system determines a series blobs associated to every blob. After colour quatization the blobs are catalogued and the saliency for every blob is calculated. The process of defining the
saliency of a blob is based on the linear combination of bottom-up(isolated blobs) and top-down(blobs with closer to the target colour) algorithms.

\section howto How to run the Application
The application is based on one main module \ref icub_saliencyBlobFinder "saliencyBlobFinder" which extracts regions which are likely to be bounded into
object afterward. This module builds as well the saliency map composed by all the blobs represent with an intensity proportional to saliency of the blob.
This image is named colorLP and is provided to the system throught the port image:o

The module \ref icub_saliencyBlobFinderInterface "saliencyBlobFinderInterface", once connected to the saliencyBlobFinder module allow the user to tune some
parameters of the algorithm and therefore to adapt the visual attention. In addition, via saliencyBlobFinderInterface, it can be forced to provide a different output:
<ul>
<li> tagged: the image composed by all the blobs filled with a gray scale equal to their list position</li>
<li> watershed: the result of the watershed operation</li>
<li> foveaBlob: the representation of the blob foveated in that moment</li>
<li> colourVQ: image composed by all the blobs filled with quantization colour</li>
<li> meanColour: the composition of all the colour filled with the mean colour of all the pixel which belong to the blob</li>
<li> maxSaliencyBlob: the representation of the max saliency blob</li>
</ul>


However the saliencyBlobFinder module needs some intensity and colour information provided respectively by the following two modules:
<ul>
<li> \ref icub_imageProcessor "imageProcessor"</li>
<li> \ref icub_colourProcessor "colourProcessor" </li>
</ul>

Finally the saliencyBlobFinder module can provide different references relative to the position of the most salient blob in the image plane.
These are interfaces towards controllers able to perform saccades and control the gaze.
