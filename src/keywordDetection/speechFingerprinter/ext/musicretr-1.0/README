Musicretr-1.0

This small collection of files aims to download, modify, build and install
the musicretr-1.0 sources.
The original sources are located at: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~yke/musicretrieval/
The musicretr-1.0 is a necessary dependency of this program and needs to be installed.

This package was designed to download the source archive and extract it.
Afterwards the sources will be patched (explained below). These patched sources
will then be build to a shared library and installed to a custom location.

Installation:
Please see INSTALL file in this directory.

Patching:
Patching of the sources is necessary because they were never ment to build as
a shared library. But since I wanted to use them in my project I decided to
do so my self.
