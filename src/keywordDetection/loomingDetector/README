LoomingDetector

This program was designed to detect looming behavior of a tutoring
person. This detection is achieved via a Kinect.
The looming classification is calculated by the mean distance of the
hand and the variance from that mean distance. If the hand comes closer
to the kinect and the distance from the mean distance is greater than 
two times the variance, looming will be assumed. The mean distance and
variance are resetted if the hand moves backwards more than 10 cm to get
a reliable looming detection.
